      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="profile-pic">
      <p>I was born and raised here in the Twin Cities. My first exposure to coding came as a teenager when my sister married
        a developer. He was entirely self taught and encouraged me to learn. Turns out not everyone can learn coding with
        just books and some free time. So after picking it up and putting it down (mostly down) over the course of 15 years
        or so, I discovered the Coding Boot Camp offered through the University of Minnesota. I had an itch to make a career
        change and it seemed like a great time to pursue the formal training and experience I would need to do it as more
        than just a hobby.

        <p>In my spare time I am a loyal Minnesota sports fan (Skol Vikings!) and a lover of almost all things music and movies.
          I have a decent sized family, where normal holiday gatherings end up being close to 40 people, so they keep me
          busy with what little time I have left.</p>

        <p>I am eager to continue learning and expanding my skillset with my classmates, and I can't wait to see where this
          journey takes me!</p>
